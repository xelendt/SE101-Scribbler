SE101-Scribbler
===============

# The Scribbler Bot will act as a surveillance robot with three modes:
 * Harassment
 * Surveillence
 * Tracking
 
 All of the robot's motion will be governed within a single while loop

---
## Harassment Mode: 
   * The robot first finds an object  
   * Next the robot turns toward the object  
   * Robot moves toward object  
   * If the robot is close enough, it speaks an alert  

---
## Surveillance Mode:
   * The robot is constantly rotating, looking for intruders  
   * If the robot finds an intruder, it speaks an alert  

---
## Tracking Mode:
   * The robot will stay stationary  
   * Using information from captured images, it will find a curve for the user and guess where the user might be moving to  
   * There will be a display of the object's position and estimated future position

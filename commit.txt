Okay, first go to https://github.com/xelendt/SE101-Scribbler

Then, under HTTPS clone, there will be a hyperlink. Copy that.
Go into a terminal and type "git clone" and then paste the
hyperlink and press enter. Now you will have all of the git 
files in your repository in that directory.

To commit to it, you start by doing "git add "filename"" and
then it is in the repository. After it is the repository, do a
"git commit". You will be brought to a screen with in vim. 
To input text, press 'i' if it does not already say ---INSERT--- 
on the bottom left corner of the terminal. Once you are done 
your message, press Esc + ':wq' + Return to commit.

Now to push to the repo, simply type "git push" into your command 
line, press Return and you are done :)
